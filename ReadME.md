# SoftUni: Lecture for JS & Bootstrap Fundamentals

This project is created to show different topics from a lecture for SoftUni regarding JS fundamentals & how to use Bootstrap.

## How to use / run this project
`index.html` & `main.js` are the main files that we're going to use. To see all of our changes we need a way to "serve" these files. For simplicity I'll use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extention and VS code. You can use any other live server you like or is being used by your IDE.

```
1) Install Live Server as an extention https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
2) Open index.html
3) Click "Go Live" in VS Code (it's placed on your bottom blue menu-bar, probably near the right corner)
```

## How to use/preview our JS Code
All of our code and examples can be called directly in the browser (be carefull with the order of your code) from the `console` - open developer tools (F12), navifate to the `Console` tab and paste your code.

Another option is to use [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com/docs/#getting-started) - either somewhere online or as an extention, eg. [VS Code Extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode)
